    "# Vector Search Interaction with Patient Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient records can be tricky, and navigating them can be tricky in healthcare. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be able to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, this is done with meticulous standards and making sure there is very clear terminology in symptoms and observations. In practice, this is not always the case. For doctors seeing a patient that has a lengthy record for the first time it can be hard to decipher the relevant parts of the file. Add inconsistent word use and suddently standard search functions become very difficult to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Vector Search and Embeddings, we can hope to fix this issue. By embedding the semantic meaning of a word, we no longer need to rely on exact word use, and other relevant reports can come through the search to enrich the search result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase this use case, I have made an AI agent that lets you filter for relevant parts of patient files from a public dataset. We will ask it things like \"Has this patient shown signs of dementia before?\" and be able to get results back of reports that might be relevant. Should, for example, there be an increase of dementia-related reports over the past 6 months or so, a medical expert might want to act on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a technical challenge, I wanted to do this entire process with the BigQuery Python library."

Pain onset was gradual, with no specific inciting incident reported. Patient quantifies pain as 6/10 at its worst, improving to 3/10 with rest. Pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, and bending forward. Patient denies any numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. Bowel and bladder function are reported as normal. Patient has attempted over-the-counter ibuprofen with minimal relief.\n",

Lateral bending is mildly restricted bilaterally. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally to 70 degrees. Palpation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles reveals moderate tenderness and guarding. No step-offs or deformities noted in the lumbar spine. Neurological examination of the lower extremities is grossly intact, with 5/5 motor strength in bilateral hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion. Sensation is intact to light touch in all dermatomes. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the patellar and Achilles tendons.\n",

      "Laboratory Data: Fasting blood glucose 195 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c 8.2%. Lipid panel shows Total Cholesterol 210 mg/dL, LDL 135 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL, Triglycerides 180 mg/dL. Urinalysis is negative for ketones and protein.\n",

      "**Assessment:**\n",
      "The patient presents with symptoms consistent with poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, as evidenced by elevated fasting blood glucose and Hemoglobin A1c. The elevated blood pressure and lipid profile also indicate the presence of comorbid cardiovascular risk factors. The patient's subjective complaints of fatigue, polydipsia, and polyuria are directly attributable to hyperglycemia. Differential diagnoses are limited given the clear laboratory findings, but include other causes of hyperglycemia which are less likely in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan:**\n",
      "1. **Medication Adjustment:** Initiate Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily with meals. Titrate dose as tolerated to achieve target glycemic control.\n",
      "2. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Reinforce importance of dietary changes including reduced intake of refined carbohydrates and sugary beverages. Encourage regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.\n",
      "3. **Education:** Provide comprehensive diabetes education regarding self-monitoring of blood glucose, medication adherence, and the long-term complications of diabetes.\n",
      "4. **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess response to medication, review blood glucose logs, and reinforce lifestyle modifications.\n",
      "5. **Further Testing:** Repeat Hemoglobin A1c in 3 months. Consider referral to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning. Monitor blood pressure and lipid profile regularly.\n",

      "1. **Medication Adjustment:** Initiate or adjust oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., Metformin) to improve glycemic control. Discuss potential need for additional agents based on HbA1c and patient response.\n",
      "2. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Reinforce the importance of a balanced diet low in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats, and regular physical activity. Refer to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning.\n",
      "3. **Monitoring:** Instruct patient on self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and to maintain a log. Schedule follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to assess response to treatment and review SMBG logs.\n",
      "4. **Further Testing:** Consider ordering urine microalbumin to screen for early signs of diabetic nephropathy. Repeat lipid panel in 3-6 months to assess response to statin therapy, if initiated.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully I've been able to showcase the power of BigQueryML here. I was impressed that all of this functionality works within SQL; I was worried that this would have to be a video showcase of me going through bigquery and setting up all these things by hand (like for example, creating the Generation and Embedding Models), but luckily this was all possible with just BigQuery calls inside Kaggle. The speed of the BigQueryML calls also surprised me, especially the similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a big fan of embeddings in the medical sphere. I've worked in healthcare-related IT for a few years and the amount of administration and bulk that these nurses and other professionals need to go through is absurd. Hopefully we can, in the near future, assist them in this proces. The quality of our models will keep improving, and I think this can be a reality soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of consistant language use inbetween organisations and programs can cause extra bloat in this administrative process. Embeddings and Classifications within GCP can realy alleviate these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to do this again, I would set up something more robust for the agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It's elegant use of sub-agents would let you run a host of queries all within the same project while still having a clean project setup.\n",
    "On top of that, I would write something to reduce the verboseness of the SOAP reports - they're quite wordy, and it troubles the embeddings somewhat. "
