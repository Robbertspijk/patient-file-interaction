    "# Vector Search Interaction with Patient Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient records can be tricky, and navigating them can be tricky in healthcare. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be able to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, this is done with meticulous standards and making sure there is very clear terminology in symptoms and observations. In practice, this is not always the case. For doctors seeing a patient that has a lengthy record for the first time it can be hard to decipher the relevant parts of the file. Add inconsistent word use and suddently standard search functions become very difficult to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Vector Search and Embeddings, we can hope to fix this issue. By embedding the semantic meaning of a word, we no longer need to rely on exact word use, and other relevant reports can come through the search to enrich the search result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase this use case, I have made an AI agent that lets you filter for relevant parts of patient files from a public dataset. We will ask it things like \"Has this patient shown signs of dementia before?\" and be able to get results back of reports that might be relevant. Should, for example, there be an increase of dementia-related reports over the past 6 months or so, a medical expert might want to act on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a technical challenge, I wanted to do this entire process with the BigQuery Python library."

The pain is localized to the lumbar region and occasionally radiates into the posterior thighs bilaterally, but does not extend below the knees. The patient reports the pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, and bending forward. They deny any recent trauma or injury. Pain intensity is rated as a 6/10 at its worst and 2/10 at its best. The patient reports mild stiffness in the morning that improves with movement. They deny any bowel or bladder incontinence, numbness, or tingling in the extremities, or fever.\n",

Extension and lateral bending are within normal limits but elicit mild discomfort. Palpation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles reveals moderate tenderness and guarding. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally to 90 degrees. Neurological examination of the lower extremities is grossly intact, with 5/5 motor strength in all muscle groups, intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, and 2+ deep tendon reflexes. No focal tenderness over the spinous processes or sacroiliac joints is noted.\n",

The absence of neurological deficits, red flag symptoms (such as bowel/bladder dysfunction, fever, or recent trauma), and significant radiation of pain suggests a non-emergent etiology. Differential diagnoses include lumbar muscle strain, lumbar ligamentous sprain, and early degenerative disc disease. Further investigation is not immediately warranted given the absence of red flag symptoms.\n",

      "2.  **Physical Therapy Referral:**\n",

      "Patient reports persistent fatigue and increased thirst over the past several weeks. They also note experiencing more frequent urination, particularly nocturia.

      "*   **Physical Examination:** General appearance is well-nourished. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam is benign. Neurological exam is grossly intact with intact sensation to light touch in extremities. No pedal edema noted.\n",

      "The patient's reported symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia, coupled with the objective findings of elevated fasting blood glucose and Hemoglobin A1c of 8.2%, are consistent with poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The elevated LDL cholesterol and borderline elevated triglycerides also indicate dyslipidemia, which is a common comorbidity. The patient's endocrine system disorder, specifically Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, is the primary issue requiring management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan:**\n",
      "1.  **Medication Adjustment:** Increase Metformin dosage to 1000 mg twice daily. Consider adding a second oral hypoglycemic agent such as a DPP-4 inhibitor or SGLT-2 inhibitor to improve glycemic control, pending further discussion with the patient.\n",
      "2.  **Lifestyle Modifications:** Reinforce the importance of dietary modifications, including reduced intake of refined carbohydrates and sugars, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods. Encourage regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. Referral to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning is recommended.\n",
      "3.  **Monitoring:** Patient to continue home blood glucose monitoring, aiming for fasting blood glucose levels between 80-130 mg/dL and postprandial levels below 180 mg/dL. Encourage daily logging of readings.\n",
      "4.  **Further Testing:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months for re-evaluation of glycemic control, including repeat Hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose. Consider ordering a urine microalbumin test to screen for early signs of diabetic nephropathy.\n",
      "5.  **Education:** Provide patient with educational materials on diabetes management, including sick day rules and recognition of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia symptoms. Discuss the importance of regular foot care and eye exams.\n",
      "6.  **Referrals:** Consider referral to a podiatrist for baseline foot examination. Discuss statin therapy for dyslipidemia management at the next visit.\n",

      "Patient reports persistent fatigue and increased thirst over the past several weeks. Denies any recent changes in diet or exercise routine. Reports occasional blurred vision, particularly in the late afternoon. No reported numbness or tingling in extremities. No history of polyuria or polydipsia prior to this recent onset.\n",

The lack of ketones or protein in the urine, and intact distal sensation, are reassuring at this time. The elevated blood pressure warrants consideration for concurrent management. The ancestral history of a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism further supports this diagnosis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hopefully I've been able to showcase the power of BigQueryML here. I was impressed that all of this functionality works within SQL; I was worried that this would have to be a video showcase of me going through bigquery and setting up all these things by hand (like for example, creating the Generation and Embedding Models), but luckily this was all possible with just BigQuery calls inside Kaggle. The speed of the BigQueryML calls also surprised me, especially the similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a big fan of embeddings in the medical sphere. I've worked in healthcare-related IT for a few years and the amount of administration and bulk that these nurses and other professionals need to go through is absurd. Hopefully we can, in the near future, assist them in this proces. The quality of our models will keep improving, and I think this can be a reality soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of consistant language use inbetween organisations and programs can cause extra bloat in this administrative process. Embeddings and Classifications within GCP can realy alleviate these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to do this again, I would set up something more robust for the agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It's elegant use of sub-agents would let you run a host of queries all within the same project while still having a clean project setup. That being said, I'm not sure how it would interact with a Kaggle Notebook and I would find it unrelated to the BigQuery usecase. Should I bring this to production, I will definitely read into it more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of that, I would write something to reduce the verboseness of the SOAP reports - they're quite wordy, and it troubles the embeddings somewhat. "
